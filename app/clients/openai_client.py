"""OpenAI client wrapper for the Reddit bot.

This module exposes a single ``client`` instance configured with the
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` environment variable. The new ``openai`` Python package
(â‰¥1.0) uses the :class:`OpenAI` class rather than the legacy
``openai.ChatCompletion`` interface. Other modules should import ``client``
from here and call ``client.chat.completions.create``.
